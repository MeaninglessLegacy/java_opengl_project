# java_opengl_project
Java game project for a course. With permission of my group members, I have cloned the repo for my own use and possible further development.

# summary
Semi-complete game engine. Designed to be as object orientated as possible. Provides methods for starting the game engine and creating and deleting game objects.

# how to use
- Create a new instance of the game engine.
- Start the game engine.
- Instantiate your first game object.

# game objects
Our main class is the "game object" every object in your game that needs to update and/or render should be extended from this class.
This class provides methods for key input, updates.

# components
Components are our way of adding features to game objects. Components include sprite renderers, when attached to a game object, the game engine will then render the sprite renderer attached to the game object.

# documentation
There is no documentation document for every class, however it is all documented in the code and should be extractable.
